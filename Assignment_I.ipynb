    " For SoloTest problem, depth-first search and A* are seemed optimal algorithms to apply. Contrarily, since we are not looking for any exceptional results, and there is no way to achieve final solution with different path cost, depth-limited and iterative deepening are weaker search algorithms to implement regarding our problem with compared to DFS and A* .\n",
    "\n",
    " For SoloTest problem we have always exact number of steps to reach the goal, which is 31. There are finite branching factors, and number of steps to the solution is fixed. DFS is optimal and complete, its space complexity is optimal. Although, its time complexity is exponential, for SoloTest problem it is not an issue to be taken into account. DLS algorithm is suitable for solving infinite-path problems, but SoloTest has no chance to have an infinite nodes when reaching the goal. Thus, it would be non-optimal and incomplete if we set its predetermined limit lower than the number of steps of SoloTest’s solution. Besides, a good depth limit would not be determined if we have not solve the problem or if number of steps to the solution was not precise. \n",
    "\n",
    " IDDFS is complete and optimal, its memory requirement is modest. It combines advantages of DFS and BFS algorithms. However, there is no difference between DFS and IDDFS, because our problem solution is fixed. Iterative deepening would be plausible if our search space was larger and depth of the solution was unknown. \n",
    "\n",
    " By defining a good heuristic function when implementing our problem into A* search algorithm, we can expand fewer nodes, by doing that time and cost efficiency is increased and A* still guarantees to reach the solution for SoloTest. Even tough its time complexity is exponential, and it keeps every node in memory, A* with a good heuristic function would still be preferable."
